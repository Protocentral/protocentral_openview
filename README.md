# ProtoCentral OpenView

ProtoCentral OpenView is a unified graphical interface for MacOS/Linux/Windows for plotting/storing sensor data from most of ProtoCentral's breakout boards and shields. This software is meant to be used with a device that presents a serial UART interface, such as an Arduino. The software is written entirely in [Processing](https://processing.org/) and fully extensible to read data from your own boards also.

## Features:

* Multiple boards, one unified interface 
* Adaptable data packet format according to type of board used
* Development environment: [Processing 3 / 4 Java](https://processing.org/)
* Compatibility: MacOS/Linux/Windows
* Data storage option to text or CSV files
* Default baud rate is 57,600 bps
*
* You can add your own board by editing the source file
